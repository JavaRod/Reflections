When you initialize a repository, you create a metadata directory for git to use.
working directory contains files which may or may not go into the repository.
only things in the staging area may go into the repository.
You only add things to the staging area that are logically related.
You would use branches to create new versions of software, try new ideas out,
create parallel versions of software.
